= Tuning your online sales =
Convead — is a service, that helps you increase your sales with automatic scenarios, including newsletters, widgets, popups, chat, text messages and ads.

Upon entering an offline store, people are instantly approached by a salesman. Otherwise they are "just looking". Good salesman carefuly pushes a customer towards the purchase — finds out the needs, gets them involved in special offers, introduces merchandise from a good side. If a customer isn’t quite ready for the purchase, the salesman will try to get his contacts to reach out later. After the purchase, the salesman will stay in touch and inform the client about new goods. Offline stores have learned to teach their salesman the engagement technique, online stores though usually let the customer go.

Convead is the salesman, automatic and for online stores. He will show customer the chosen special offer, ask his email, phone number, at the right moment he will activate an online chat. If a client leaves the website, Convead will do his best to try and bring him back, even if the customer spent few moments and didn’t have a chance to say hello. As for existing clients, Convead will tell them about new merchandise, wish them happy birthday or offer special purchase conditions.

It’s not magic — Convead needs to be set up. But the time you spend on it will be greatly  compensated by the number of new sales. Without new ads expences.
